IMPORTANT NOTES ABOUT USING SQUIRREL

This document is intented for those who write scripts.
Its purpose is to adress common issues and singularities of the language,
in order to reduce the amount of errors.

1) STATIC INITIALIZATION OF MEMBERS

	Squirrel doesn't clone member's default values nor executes the member declaration for each
	instance (as C# or java). So consider this example:

	class Foo {
		myarray = [1,2,3]
		mytable = {}
	}

	local a = Foo()
	local b = Foo()

	In the snippet above both instances will refer to the same array and same table.
	To achieve what a C# or Java programmer would exepect, the following approach should be taken.

	class Foo {
		myarray = null
		mytable = null	

		constructor() {
			myarray = [1,2,3]
			mytable = {}
		}
	}

	local a = Foo()
	local b = Foo()

2) CLASS ATTRIBUTES

	In C#, Java or Python, you can annotate your classes with special attributes.
	In Squirrel you can do it too, but they should be INSIDE the class.
	Here is a particular case that might lead to a mistake:

	</ Test="lol" />
	class Foo {
		// Althougth it's similar to the C# annotation system, it doesn't works
	}

	class Foo </ Test="lol" /> {
		// This works
	}

	class Foo {
		// This works too
		</ Test="lol" />
	}
